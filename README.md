Competency app development using Flutter with dart as the frontend
Python-Django as the backend
PostgreSql as the DB

Below is the blueprint:
----------------
   - Objective: Develop an open-source mobile app to enhance the skills and knowledge of team members within Epiroc.
   - Features:
     - User Profiles: Utilize Firebase Authentication for user authentication and profile management.
     - Learning Modules: Integrate LinkedIn Learning courses seamlessly into the app using Moodle. Access a vast library of interactive learning modules from LinkedIn Learning directly within the app. Users can enroll in courses, view video lectures, complete quizzes, and track their progress all within the app interface.
     - Progress Tracking: Track and monitor individual learning progress and completion statuses within the app. Integration with LinkedIn Learning and Moodle enables real-time progress tracking, allowing users to see their completed courses, achievements, and upcoming learning activities.
     - Resource Library: Access a centralized repository of learning resources and materials within the app. Curate a collection of supplementary resources, documents, and reference materials to complement LinkedIn Learning courses. Users can search, browse, and bookmark resources for easy access during their learning journey.
     - Discussion Forums: Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members through integrated discussion forums. Engage in meaningful discussions, ask questions, and share insights related to LinkedIn Learning courses and competency development topics. The integration with Moodle's discussion forums enables seamless communication and peer-to-peer learning within the app.
   - Technology Stack:
     - Platform: Cross-platform development using Flutter with Dart for business logic.
     - Backend: Python with Django for building a scalable backend server.
     - Database: PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, learning progress, and content metadata.
   - Benefits:
     - Leverages open-source technologies to reduce development costs and promote collaboration within the developer community.
     - Provides flexibility and customization options, allowing for tailored solutions to meet specific learning objectives and requirements.
     - Fosters a culture of openness and knowledge sharing, aligning with Epiroc's commitment to innovation and continuous learning.
